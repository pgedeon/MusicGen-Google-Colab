# MusicGen-Google-Colab
Google colab book for Facebook Research music gen and AudioCraft. Book will save multiple clips by adding a number after the description. This book will save each sample to the colab instance then connect to google drive and save wav sample files to specified folder. This allows for easy export to your favorate music production software via google drive file sync.

Enjoy, the code written on AudioCraft was not written for easy export and the generation of multiple clips was not possible because it would overwrite the existing ones.
